Thank you for freeing me! We have been locked away for centuries. 
There has been a wild spirit running free and corrupting our world. Please free my remaining brothers.  
Please free my remaining brothers.
My kind known as guardians have been seal aways in these magical stones called Spirans.
There are many others stuck in Spirans. Can you free more of us guardians?
So that we can bring the life back to this world.
I can see a strange artifact on the floor, looks like some kind of switch.
Here's a switch to rise a bridge to get across.
cheers.
