Thank you so much for saving me!
I have been stuck within that stone for years.
This world has fallen into a deep depression without us here to protect it.
My kind known as guardians have been seal aways in these magical stones called Spirans.
There are many others stuck in Spirans. Can you free more of us guardians?
So that we can bring the life back to this world.
I can see a strange artifact on the floor, looks like some kind of switch.
Here's a switch to rise a bridge to get across.
cheers.
